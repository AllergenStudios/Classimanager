Just a simple server manager using MCGalaxy as the server software for Classicube.

The folder where the servers are stored is called "ClassiCube Servers" in your user directory.

It has a add server feature (downloads and extracts the latest release from the official MCGalaxy repository),
a delete server feature,
and a launch server feature, which launches the MCGalaxy.exe inside of it.

Everything is self explanatory, enjoy!
